Welcome to sphinxcontrib-jupyter's documentation!
=================================================

This sphinx extension can be used to build a collection of
`Jupyter <http://jupyter.org>`__ notebooks for Sphinx Projects.

**Note:** It has mainly been written to support the use case of
scientific publishing and hasn't been well tested outside of this
domain. Please provide feedback as an issue to this 
`repository <https://github.com/QuantEcon/sphinxcontrib-jupyter>`__.
